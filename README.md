# djs-testing
Suite of testing bots for several discord.js versions and applications

Each application needs a file `.env` in its root directory containing

```
TOKEN=71pjmILeAvX0CmSRnKBDnOCh50llqGe4Q0tmwBiDwcoi2iO9b30i70iug3f
OWNER=83886770768314368
PREFIX=!
```

If multiple owners are desired they can be separated with a comma:
`OWNER=83886770768314368,175179625880616960`

Each bot has an eval command locked to owners. Giving eval access to __anyone__ is generally a bad idea.
